# Tetris

### Todo
* Score system/Displaying score
* Create/Polish UI
* Holding down movement keys
* Wall kicks!

### Consider
* Changing playTimer (timer that is displayed as part of the UI) to a float
* Breaking up PlayState class in to IO (rendering/key events) and game logic, instead of one big class
* Revisit the rotation function, some of the pivot points seem off a bit

### Bugs
* Rotation ignores block collision
* Rotation ignores left, right and bottom board boundaries. (Ignores top as well, but I restricted the drawing above the board to continue to allow it to ignore the top boundary)
* Menu stays visible when MenuState is called while in PauseState. For the time being, Iâ€™m disabling MenuState while in PauseState and GameOverState. Might look in to fixing the redraw issue later.
* Movement while a tetrimino has any block with a y < 0 is really restricted/non-working
*
